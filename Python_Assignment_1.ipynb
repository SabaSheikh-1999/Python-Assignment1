        "Python is one of the most popular programming languages and easiest language for the beginners.  Here are the key features that contribute to its popularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Simple and Easy to Learn**: Python is easy to read because it's laguage is quite like english which helps beginners to learn and understand cods fast as compared to other programming language like C, C++, Java, etc, Python is the easiest language to learn and master.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Widely Used in Multiple Domains**: We can use pythong for various platforms. It can be used to create all sorts of web and mobile applications, from advanced financial service. Here are some examples of domain:\n",
        "\n",
        "a) Web develpoment\n",
        "\n",
        "b) Data analysis and Data science\n",
        "\n",
        "c) Machiene learning and AI\n",
        "\n",
        "d) Game development\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Free and open source**: Pythong is free and open souce which means we can learn this programming laguage from any source withou fee and we can also download it and use it withou any copyright issue. It is widely use laguage because it's a free and easy programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Cross-Platform Language**: Python is a cross-platform language. We can run python on multiple operating systems like windows, macOS and Linux. Many times while donwloading some software there is different version for different operating sysytem but in python it's not like that we can use python in every system.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dynamic Typing:** Dynamic typing means that we don't need to declare the data type of a variable before using it. The data type is determined at runtime, based on the assigned value.This feature of python saves a lot of time and helps us to avoid pitfalls that might have occurred if it required the datatype to be mentioned explicitly.\n",

We use different mathematical logic in Python to implement if-else statements and check conditions in various situations. Here are the operators we use with Python conditional statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "Equals (==)- We use it to check if a variable is equal to another variable. For example, m == n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not Equals )!=)- To check if a variable is not equal to another variable. For example, m != n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Greater Than (>)- To check if a variable is greater than another variable. For example, m > n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Less Than (<)- To check if a variable is less than another variable. For example, m < n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Greater Than or Equal to- To assess if a variable is greater than or equal to another variable. For example, m >= n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Less Than or Equal to- To evaluate if a variable is less than or equal to another variable. For example, m <= n.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most conditional statements are:"
